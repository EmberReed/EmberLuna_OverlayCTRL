# EmberLuna_OverlayCTRL
A program for controlling OBS while streaming on twitch. 

This program is currently setup very specifically for our streaming setup, but i do have plans in the future to make it more generic and portable for other streamers to use in their own setups. 

This uses a combination of twitchlib and OBSwebsocket to create all kinds of events and features triggered by interactions with twitch users live while streaming. It also allows us to create some fun interactive games to be played while streaming. We haven't gone live in a bit, but we intend to in  the near future once enough of the features are fully tested and ready for prime-time.

The program has structures for managing SFX, Media events, twitch users, channel-points, and two character sprites that are part of our overlay. There are a number of other great features that when networked toghether allow us to fully automate any number of events. 

We're not great at streaming, but love working on our setup.
